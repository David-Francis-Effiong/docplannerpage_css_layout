# Project Name: Doc Planner Group Webpage Clone CSS External Styling

In this project, I created a basic webpage clone for the Doc Planner group as seen <a href = "https://docplanner-gomycode.onrender.com/index.html>Doc Planner Group</a> I used HTML to structure the content and include some 
semantic tags and elements like headings, main, section, paragraphs, div, and footer.

## specifications

- The header section was inserted with navigation to three menus, 'About', 'Career', and 'Department'.
- I used the link tag to link the html page with an external css (docplanlayout.css).
- There is a middle section containing the company mission.
- I inserted two paragraphs and placed them in columns (side by side) inside the 'page_columns' class.
- I inserted a card-container class with three cards (patients, doctors and clinics) each having a description and a dropdown content of different countries.
- I inserted two drop-down content for the last card (clinics).
- Images from some countries were inserted in three rows (with the last image in row 4 centralized) and the use of the button tag was seen in the page. 
- Different brand logos were inserted into the webpage and proper styling was done to ensure they align.
- I added links at the bottom of the page leading to some countries using the <footer> tag.
- The 'footer-privacy' class was created for the last paragraph in the footer tag.
